Inline Styles:
***********

Inline styles are the simplest way, syntactically, to style a component in React Native,
though they are not usually the best way

Example:
********

<Text>
The quick <Text style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>brown</Text> fox
jumped over the lazy <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>dog</Text>.
</Text>

However, you should avoid them in general, because theyâ€™re less efficient.
Inline style
objects must be recreated during each render pass.
